Hi, here is another coding blog. I don't know how many blogs I've started and abandoned over the years, but its probably double digits (or nearly). I have no idea if this will stick this time, so set your expectations low. I basically wanted a way to share stuff that I was stuck on while developing and had difficulty finding posts to help me get unstuck.

I make no promises that it will be interesting, nor timely, nor around in the future (that's what the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is for).

Here is some meta information. This is a blog, hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I'm using the [Reverie theme](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) (because you don't want to see me try to design a theme).

Oh, and who am I? I'm Ryan, just a guy who has been writing code for several decades. I know some stuff, but still a ton I don't know.
