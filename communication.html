<h1>Communicating with Ryan</h1>
<p>
  In an effort to be more productive, I have established a set of guidelines for how I will use
  various communication mediums. In an effort to set the expectations of others, I am sharing those
  guidelines here.
</p>

<p>
  In general, I prefer that you send me email when a response is either not required or not needed
  that day. That said, I will generally try to respond to an email by end of each day. When you need
  a response from me within an hour or two, I prefer either SMS text messages or a phone call.
</p>

<h2>E-mail</h2>
<p>
  In an effort to reclaim my life from my email inbox, I plan to read email just twice a day. Once
  around 1 pm, and again around 8 pm. Please do not expect that I have read your email sent
  late the previous evening until 1pm the following day. I will generally not respond to email that
  do not require a response.
</p>

<h2>Phone & Voice Messages</h2>
<p>
  I will not answer a call if I do not recognize the caller's name or number as provided by caller ID.
  I expect that people with important calls will leave a voice message or try another medium, such as
  SMS text message. I will make every effort to listen to a voice message ASAP. I will return important
  calls ASAP. Other calls will be returned at my convenience.
</p>

<h2>Text Messages (SMS)</h2>
<p>
  I will generally read text messages as they come in, and respond when necessary. I prefer receiving messages that do not require a response via email.
